# qualtrics-backup
A script to download backup files for Qualtrics surveys

Requires a JSON file in the same directory (called `qualtrics-status.json`) in order to keep track of which surveys need to be backed up.

Automatically stores CSV files in `QualtricsBackup` folder in the same directory and XML files in the `QualtricsBackup/XML Files` folder.
